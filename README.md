# Your-Story-Here

YOUR STORY HERE is an ORGP - Online Role Playing Game. This is a single player ORPG. The difference between this ORPG and others is that every time you start a new game your story and game play change based on the type of character you start with. There are a total of four different characters in the game. Yet that is chosen by random selection.

The purpose of YOUR STORY HERE is to make the player think about their everyday life, as well the life of the other 7 billion people on Earth. The main intent is to create a disconnect from the rat race that we know as the world. This is done by allowing the user to choose their own story, but each choice leads to a result. At the end of the game the player will get a summary of their story, reminding them of where their choices led. 

# Coding

The base of the game is built with HTML5, CSS3, and JS. On the Javascript side I used [Angular JS](https://angularjs.org/) for simple DOM manipulation. For routing I used [Angular UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router).

All data for the game is saved using local storage.
